The purpose of this documentation is to present our project. The project requirement was to develop a Dashboard web parcel management service. We established an interface system that could be used by courier-companies\textbackslash customers\textbackslash postman's for monitoring and updating the package status and condition. The package data is being store in the blockchain, therefore the data is cross-company own. For bringing the data from the blockchian to the dashboard we developed a backend communication level API.
The system enable all parties involve in the package delivery to communicate with one uncentrelized source.
