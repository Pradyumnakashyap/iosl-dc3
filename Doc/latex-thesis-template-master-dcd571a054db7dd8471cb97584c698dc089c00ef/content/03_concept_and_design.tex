\chapter{Concept and Design}
\label{cha:conceptanddesign}

DC3 does have 3 different types of personas, Company, Customer and Postman. Hence we had to design the system differently for each user persona. Our front end application is a Single Page Application (SPA) using reactive native. Our back-end is developed by using Node JS leveraging Express framework. 

\section{Database Design}
DC3 database has 8 tables. Order, Person, Order History and Order sensors are the major tables while others play an important role as well.  designs majorly circulate around Orders table. We have normalized the database to avoid storing redundant data e.g. Order and Sensors had many to many relationship so we divided it and created another table, OrderSensors. Letâ€™s understand the philosophy behind each table


\subsection{Company}
The company table is persisting the information about all the companies. It stores the company name and a brief description of the company. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l| } 
 \hline
Id & Int - auto increment & Unique company ID \\
 \hline
Name & varchar & Company Name \\
 \hline
Description & varchar & Brief company description \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\subsection{Address}
Address table is maintaining all kind of address across the whole system, be it order adree or customer home address. Hence it has relationship with Order and Person. Order table has two address Ids, each for pick and delivery address of the order

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l| } 
 \hline
AddressID & Int - auto increment & \\
 \hline
StreetAddress  & varchar  & \\
 \hline
City  & varchar &\\
 \hline
Country  & varchar &\\
 \hline
PostCode  & int &\\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
